      <img class="how-to-shoot" src="app/assets/ui_images/static/how_to_photo_1.jpg">
      <p class="md-subhead">Use natural light, set up your shot outside during daylight or indoors near a window or a white wall. Early morning and late afternoon light will produce best results. Keep your background as simple as possible. Try to create a contrast to your bicycle. For example you can place your bicycle in front of a concrete wall.</p>
