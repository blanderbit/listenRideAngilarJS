                listnride is a community bike-sharing platform, like the Airbnb for bicycles. With a large amount and variety of bikes, our
                users can easily rent bicycles, matching their style and purpose. Be it for a sightseeing trip, for a fast
                cycling tour or for a family holiday. Having direct contact with a local, the bike owner, recommendations
                on the best cycling routes in the city and or a nice museum or coffee shop, are easily shared. Bikes are
                provided by private listers, bike shop and bike brands aiming to connect with potential prospects. Founded
                in Berlin listnride is growing fast into other cities e.g. Amsterdam, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna as well
                as bike regions e.g. Mallorca. We have set our ambition high and want to be the leading p2p bike sharing
                provider in Europe by the end of 2018.
