      "faq-question-1": "What is a Singlespeed / Fixie bike?",
      "faq-answer-1": "For fast urban riding in (mostly) flat cities, the simplest way is to have just one gear. Singlespeed / Fixie bikes also benefit from a cleaner, more minimalist appearance. In addition to that, you can choose the position of the rear wheel; set it up as a singlespeed (freewheel / coasting possible), or as a fixed gear.",
      "faq-question-2": "What exactly is the difference between a Singlespeed and a Fixie?",
      "faq-answer-2": "It all comes down to one thing: the rear wheel. Singlespeed bikes have just one gear, but use a freehub which lets the rider coast without pedaling. The rider typically stops or slows the bike using rim brakes. When the wheel is mounted with the fixed hub, the bike becomes a fixed gear. In this setup, when the bike is rolling, the pedals are spinning - there’s no coasting. Experienced riders feel more control with this setup, and can stop or slow down using the pedals. We recommend always riding with both brakes fully assembled.",
      "faq-question-3": "What makes bonvelo bikes so great?",
      "faq-answer-3": "Do you commute daily to work or school? Perfect, because our bikes are made for this. Cobbles and rough roads are no problem for the 32-spoke wheel, and the Thickslick tire offers great durability and traction against anything the road puts underneath it. The frame is developed in-house - it’s extremely stable, and looks great, too. Bring all this together and the result is a dynamic, agile and durable bike, perfect for the urban jungle!",
      "faq-question-4": "How is my bonvelo delivered? What do I have to assemble?",
      "faq-answer-4": "We ship approximately 80% of our bikes to customers throughout Germany and the rest of Europe. We’ve chosen UPS as our shipping partner, and we pack our bikes securely in bike boxes for safe delivery to your door.

      "faq-question-5": "Why are the bikes so cheap?",
      "faq-answer-5": "We’re not concerned with frills or gimmicks, and designing a bike around this principle was an early goal of ours. All processes run directly through our manufacturers and producers, so there are no middlemen adding to the final price.

How to determine your step length: You need a cane and a water balance. If you do not have a water scale, you can easily use a book. Pull out your shoes and pants (depending on how pants are cut, it affects the result). If you have a water scale, pull it upwards as far as possible between the legs. It works the same way with a book, but you should place yourself on a door or wall so that the top of your 'meter' is parallel to the ground. Now measure the stick from the floor to the upper edge of the water scale or the book. The value you have now determined is your so-called step length (step height)."
