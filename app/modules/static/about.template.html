        <h3  class="md-subhead">listnride: the idea that sparked a community</h3>
        <p>Here at listnride, we all love bikes. Each of us has their personal favorite that they cherish, and we enjoy the wonderful diversity of two-wheelers: from urban bikes to mountain bikes, from speedy road bikes to super-fast S-pedelecs, from eccentric ponies to reliable pack mules. That’s why we began asking ourselves: Why isn’t it possible to choose and have a specific bike that you need for a particular purpose at any time, regardless of whether you’re traveling or in your home town? Will we always be stuck with the low-entry bikes from the local rental shop? And thus the idea of setting up the listnride bike sharing community was born.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">listnride: full speed ahead</h3>
        <p>Today, listnride is available in big cities like Amsterdam, Berlin, Munich and Vienna. And that number keeps growing. Private owners as well as specialized dealers offer their bikes for rent on our platform. This enables tourists and locals, families and businesspeople to find the ideal bike that complements their personal style and meets their needs – and perhaps even get one or two useful tips about the local area from the lister.</p>
        <p>Our idea has become a reality. Be a part of it and share your bike – or simply ride any bike you want! We look forward to welcoming you to our community.</p>
